# GEE FOREST

<b>Abstract:</b> Javascript code to evaluate a forest recovering area for a time period. Based on Google Earth Engine environment (GEE) and Google's Dynamic World images.

This project stems from a real case conducted in the year 2022, with the objective of comparing forest development between the period of 2015 to 2022, prioritizing the detection of degraded areas that underwent successful reforestation and transformation.

The restorarion project was divided into two target-areas, representing an approximate area of 985 hectares (2,435 acres). The project lands enfolded regions with forest, grass, crops, shrub & scrub, flooded vegetation, built-up area, bare ground and water.

This project evaluated the land transformation between 2015 and 2022 aiming to update the data abaout the areas and review the costs of maintenance (for short and long-term planning).

# RESULTS
After conducting this study, it was possible to reduce the maintenance costs by nearly US$ 34,572 dollars per year (BRL 172,861.39/year). This reduction represents almost 55% of the annual budget for the maintenance program.


NOTES:
This code was tested on a GEE environment. To run it outside GEE, it's necessary to work with libraries available in JS and Python languages.

More details of the project, methodology and results to be added in due time.
