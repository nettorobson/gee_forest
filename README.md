# gee_forest
Abstract: Javascript code to evaluate a forest recovering area for a time period. Based on Google Earth Engine environment (GEE) and Google's Dynamic World images.

NOTES:
This code was tested on a GEE environment. To run it outside GEE, it's necessary to work with libraries available in JS and Python languages.
