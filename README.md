# gee_forest
Abstract: Javascript code to evaluate a forest recovering area for a time period. Based on Google Earth Engine environment (GEE) and Google's Dynamic World images.

This project stems from a real case conducted in the year 2022, with the objective of comparing forest development between the period of 2015 to 2022, prioritizing the detection of degraded areas that underwent successful reforestation and transformation.







NOTES:
This code was tested on a GEE environment. To run it outside GEE, it's necessary to work with libraries available in JS and Python languages.

More details of the project, methodology and results to be added in due time.
