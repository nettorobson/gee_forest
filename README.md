# GEE FOREST

<b>Abstract:</b> Javascript code to evaluate a forest recovering area for a time period. Based on Google Earth Engine environment (GEE) and Google's Dynamic World images.

This project stems from a real case conducted in the year 2022, with the objective of comparing forest development between the period of 2015 to 2022, prioritizing the detection of degraded areas that underwent successful reforestation and transformation.

The restorarion project was divided into two target-areas, representing an approximate area of 985 hectares (2,435 acres). The project lands enfolded regions with forest, grass, crops, shrub & scrub, flooded vegetation, built-up area, bare ground and water.

This project evaluated the land transformation between 2015 and 2022 aiming to update the data abaout the areas and review the costs of maintenance (for short and long-term planning).

## METHODS
### Field Research + GIS

### Field Research
For the evaluation of the restoration areas in the Riparian Protection Area (APP), reference points were assessed across the target areas, providing environmental and local forest descriptions along with photographic documentation. For the descriptive assessment of the areas under analysis, general parameters about the locality, forest condition, presence of area isolation, maintenance execution, occurrence of exotic species and invasive grasses, replanting efforts, topography, and other aspects were collected. Aspects such as the presence of wildlife in the areas, evidence of exotic vegetation, the presence of leaf-cutting ants, burn scars, and other additional factors were also observed.

### GIS:
The database used for land use and land cover classification is the Dynamic World (BROWN et al., 2022), a high-tech and high-accuracy database with a temporal approximation to near real-time, globally applicable, and published in 2022. The algorithms employed are semi-supervised, based on established GIS systems (such as MapBiomas, for example). This land use classification aligns with the IPCC's best practices guide (PENMAM et al., 2003). The Dynamic World database's methodology is detailed in Brown et al.'s work (2022).


## RESULTS
After conducting this study, it was possible to <b>reduce the maintenance costs by nearly US$ 34,572 dollars per year</b> (BRL 172,861.39/year). This reduction represents almost <b>55% of the annual budget</b> for the maintenance program.

## NOTES
The customer, location and more detailed data are omitted due confidenciality reasons.

This code was tested on a GEE environment. To run it outside GEE, it's necessary to work with libraries available in JS and Python languages.

More details of the project, methodology and results to be added in due time.
